In this project, I implemented an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game using deep Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique. The agent, representing a pirate NPC, mastered the maze's complexities by iteratively refining its decisions based on rewards and penalties associated with different actions, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation. Utilizing neural networks, the deep Q-learning algorithm allowed the agent to map states to actions, ensuring adaptive and intelligent decision-making. This approach combined human-like exploration with machine learning, resulting in a sophisticated and effective pathfinding solution for the game.
